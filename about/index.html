	<h1>About</h1>
	<subtitle>
	My name is Alice and I am a PhD student. I am interested in how statistical genetics and omics can be applied to help understand neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions. I also like using R + Adobe Illustrator to investigate and visualise other types of data.
		
	I made this page to keep track of different methods I come across!
